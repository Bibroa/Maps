Interactive Maps – Skills2Capabilities

This repository contains interactive maps developed within the Horizon Europe project Skills2Capabilities.

The maps show dimensions of structural transformation at the regional level for several European countries, including Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Estonia, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom.

The folder contains HTML files with interactive visualizations on indicators such as migration, unemployment, demographic change, and digital transformation.

The maps aim to raise awareness of how structural changes impact regions differently across Europe.
They highlight economic, technological, demographic, ecological, and normative developments, and they serve as a basis for further analysis and evidence-based policy advice.

All visualizations are based on regionalized data from Eurostat, national statistical offices, and other official sources.

The maps accompany the technical report: "Shifting Landscapes: Structural transformations that shape the VET workforce across European regions" (Weßling & Loll, 2025).
